# Active Context: AccEnvix Website

## Current Work Focus
Establishing the foundational memory bank for the AccEnvix website project. This includes setting up all core documentation files that will guide future development and maintain consistency across the project lifecycle.

## Recent Changes
- Initialized memory bank structure
- Created core documentation files based on .clinerules framework
- Established project brief and product context

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining memory bank files (systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md)
2. Review existing project structure and files to understand current state
3. Identify gaps between planned architecture and current implementation
4. Begin documenting system patterns and technical context based on existing codebase

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Following the established .clinerules framework for documentation
- Ensuring all memory bank files align with the project brief and product context
- Maintaining consistency with existing codebase and technology choices
- Planning for future scalability and maintainability

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Modern web development practices
- Clean, professional design aesthetic
- Performance optimization
- Responsive design principles
- Maintainable code architecture

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Project is built with React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Vite
- Existing file structure suggests a component-based architecture
- ShadCN UI components are integrated
- Testing infrastructure appears to be in place (vitest)
- Project follows modern frontend development practices
